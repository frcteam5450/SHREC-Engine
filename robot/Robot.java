 * Project Name: SHREC 5450 Robot Control Application.
 * 
 * Description: This is a Java program built around the WPI library command-based
 * robot. This project includes subsystem representations, motors, servos, 
 * solenoids, sensors, along with driver controlled functionality and autonomous
 * functionality using computer vision.
 * 
 * Contributors: Brandon Trabucco - Programming Lead,
 * Bryce Trabucco - Programmer Lv. 1,
 * Miguel Cruz - Programmer Lv. 1.
 * 
 * References: WPI Library - https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib,
 * OpenCV - http://opencv.org/,

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Version: 0.1.0.
 * 
 * Date: February 2, 2017.
 * 
 * Name: Switchable Drive.
 * 
 * Description: A simple robot control application that implements PID
 * to allow straight driving and consistent turning speed during teleop. This program
 * uses a Gyro connected to the roboRio computer via SPI. This program also can
 * toggle between mechanum and traction-based driving.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Version: 0.1.1
 * 
 * Date: February 8, 2017.
 * 
 * Name: JoyStick Functionality.
 * 
 * Description: This program is built onto the old version. Quite a few
 * things were added. This program uses input from a button on a joyStick to spin a 
 * flyWheel in both directions to launch fuel. Also, using joyStick input, it can activate 
 * a piston that will slide our gear catcher open and close it. Currently, autonomous 
 * code for test purposes was added. The autonomous code makes the robot drive forward,
 * turn 180 degrees in the positive direction, and drive back.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Version: 0.1.2
 * 
 * Date: February 10, 2017
 * 
 * Name: Subsystem Integration
 * 
 * Description: This version includes code to control a four-wheel switcheable-mechanum
 * driveTrain, a piston-actuated gearTray, a single-shooter ball shooter, and a single motor
 * climbing spool mechanism. This version also supports a left and right joyStick setup, which
 * corresponds to the left and right sides of the robot, respectively. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Version: 0.1.3
 * 
 * Date: February 12, 2017
 * 
 * Name: LED Power
 * 
 * Description: This version contains code to run an LED NeoPixel strip, which
 * is attached to an arduino. The program contains a subsystem that tells the
 * arduino what the robot is doing. The arduino will respond to each state by
 * playing a sequence of patterns on the arduino.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Version: 0.1.4
 * 
 * Date: February 18, 2017
 * 
 * Name: UDP Computer Vision
 * 
 * Description: This version includes a vision subsystem that communicates with a
 * raspberry pi based computer vision algorithm. This algorithm locates the boiler
 * and gear hook using OpenCV, calculates an x, y, and z position and velocity,
 * and transmits this information to the roborio through a UDP Datagram Socket.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Version: 0.1.5
 * 
 * Date: March 10, 2017
 * 
 * Name: Tested Computer Vision
 * 
 * Description: This version of this robot project implements teleop and autonomous
 * PID Controllers that aid the user in controlling a drive subsystem, along with a
 * UDP Socket based communication interface with a Raspberry Pi. This socket is error
 * friendly, and will restart communication if an error occurs.
