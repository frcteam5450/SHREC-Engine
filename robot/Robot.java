 * Project Name: SHREC 5450 Robot Control Application.
 * 
 * Description: This is a Java program built around the WPI library command-based
 * robot. This project includes subsystem representations, motors, servos, 
 * solenoids, sensors, along with driver controlled functionality and autonomous
 * functionality using computer vision.
 * 
 * Contributors: Brandon Trabucco - Programming Lead,
 * Bryce Trabucco - Programmer Lv. 1,
 * Miguel Cruz - Programmer Lv. 1.
 * 
 * References: WPI Library - https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib,

 * 
 * Old Version: 0.1.0.
 * 
 * Date: February 2, 2017.
 * 
 * Old Version Name: Switchable Drive.
 * 
 * Old Version Description: A simple robot control application that implements PID
 * to allow straight driving and consistent turning speed during teleop. This program
 * uses a Gyro connected to the roboRio computer via SPI. This program also can
 * toggle between mechanum and traction-based driving.
 * 
 * New version: 0.1.1
 * 
 * Date: February 8, 2017.
 * 
 * New Version Name: JoyStick Functionality.
 * 
 * New Version Description: This program is built onto the old version. Quite a few
 * things were added. This program uses input from a button on a joyStick to spin a 
 * flyWheel in both directions to launch fuel. Also, using joyStick input, it can activate 
 * a piston that will slide our gear catcher open and close it. Currently, autonomous 
 * code for test purposes was added. The autonomous code makes the robot drive forward,
 * turn 180 degrees in the positive direction, and drive back.
 *
