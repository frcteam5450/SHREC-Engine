# Who are we?
We are the St. Helens Robotics and Engineering Club (SHREC). We are FRC Team 5450, affiliated with the FIRST organization. Our team consists of high school students grades 9 through 12 and adult mentors from the community. We competed at the 2016 FRC World CHampionship in St. Louis.

# Background of This Year's Competition
FRC stands for FIRST Robotics Competition. This year, the world-wide challenge was to create a robot that could
deliver gears to a hook, climb a rope, and launch wiffle balls into a goal that is about 10 feet off the ground.
